# **Hotel Reviews NLP Sentiment Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze **hotel reviews** and classify sentiments. By leveraging **NLTK's Vader** and **Hugging Face's DistilBERT**, the goal is to extract insights that help businesses improve customer satisfaction and service quality.

## **Why This Matters**
- **Hotels rely on customer feedback** to enhance experiences and increase bookings.
- **Manually analyzing thousands of reviews** is inefficientâ€”NLP automates this process.
- **Sentiment insights drive data-informed decisions** for hospitality businesses.

## **Key Results**
- **Achieved 89% model accuracy** in sentiment classification.
- **Identified top and bottom-rated hotels** based on sentiment analysis.
- **Provided business insights** to optimize hotel services.
